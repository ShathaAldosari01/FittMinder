# FittMinder
## Introduction 
> It is an android application that focuses on the fitness field that makes people able to manage and organize their workout schedule easily.

## The problem
> Nowadays some people find themselves busy and they tend to list the tasks that need to be done to make sure they won’t forget them, especially in the fitness field as many people forget to exercise. Also, one of the common ways people use to manage their exercises is by writing them down on a piece of paper which is inefficient since the paper may get lost or they may forget to check their list repeatedly to see what exercises they need to do on that day as well as the time they specified. Also, what’s even worse is that they may forget to bring that notebook of their fitness tasks. Therefore, we will develop this application that will help them in planning and scheduling their fitness tasks in a faster, easier way to ensure they won't forget to exercise.

 ## The scope
> The system will **cover** several main functions such as giving the user the ability to add an exercise task or reminder with a specific date and time, sending a notification for the reminder at the time the user has specified, viewing and deleting any existing reminders or tasks, checking an existing task or reminder and giving the user the ability to specify the exercise intensity when they add new reminders or tasks.

> The things that we **won't** cover are giving the user the option to split the exercises into categories, having built-in reminders, statistics that show weekly progress for example how many times did the user exercise in a certain week, restoring the deleting tasks, repetitive reminders, categorizing the exercise based on the priority. Also, the ability to edit reminders or tasks and to share a reminder to other users.
